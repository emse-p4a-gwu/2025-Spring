Hadley Wickham (chief data scientist at RStudio and author of many amazing R packages you’ll be using) made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions in Slack, and try it again later.\nI promise, you can do this!",

If you arrive late, you will be allowed to take the quiz in the remaining time left. Make ups will only be allowed for excused absences that are discussed and agreed upon with the professor prior to class. If you contact the professor after class for a make up, it will not be granted under any circumstances. If you cannot make it to class because of an emergency, you should notify the professor before class.\nQuizzes are short (10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. They will cover material presented in previous classes and assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel.",

    "text": "Rounding\nI do not round final grades. Here’s why. Wherever the line is drawn, there will always be students just below or just above, and rounding will only move that bar and create another group of students who are just below and just above. Rounding does not eliminate the issue but rather just shifts it to another group of students. This is why I draw the lines before the course starts - to ensure a fair and transparent system for everyone, that way you don’t have to shoot for a moving bar. To be clear, this means I will not modify or round your final score, even if you’re very close to a different letter grade (e.g., a 93.98 is an “A-” and will not be rounded up to an “A”).\nRather than round, I grade generously throughout the semester. For example, if you give a quiz your best shot and completely fail it, you will likely get a 50% instead of a 0%. The 50% is for trying as there’s still some learning that happens when you try (0s are reserved for those who simply don’t take it).",

    "text": "Collaboration Policy\n\nLearning how to program is like learning how to ride a bicycle - to get better, you must practice writing code yourself. Therefore, we have a set of strict rules regarding what kind of collaboration is allowed, what counts as over-collaboration, and what counts as cheating.\n\nGood Collaboration\n\nDiscussing which general concepts might be useful in solving a problem (conditionals, loops, etc.).\nAsking for debugging help with code.\nSketch out algorithms on a whiteboard together.\nTo avoid copying the code, you should write up the solution together, discuss it, then erase the solution, wait a few minutes, and write up solutions individually.\nHelp each other debug specific parts of assignment code.\nGeneral discussion of course concepts.\nDetailed explanations of example code on the course website.\nCollaboratively solving a practice problem, with any level of co-writing code and co-debugging.\n\n\n\nOver-collaboration\nOver-collaboration results in a warning on the first offense, and a penalty on later offenses. Examples include:\n\nExplaining to a friend how to solve a problem in high-level terms by going through your own program line-by-line.\nHelping a friend debug code by suggesting they use your own approach to the problem.\nCollaborating with a student on an assignment and then not including their name as a collaborator in the assignment writeup.\nIn the case that you have taken this course before, copying your own code from the previous time you took the course.\n\n\n\nCheating\nCheating results in a penalty on the first offense, and failing the course on the second offense. Cheating on assignments can include:\n\nCopying or stealing any amount of code from someone currently in the class or someone who has taken the class before. Copying is never okay, whether the code is provided electronically, visually, audibly, or on paper.\nProviding code you have written for an assignment to anyone else in the class.\nFinding code online and using it in the assignment (one exception: you may use code from the course website).\nPutting code solutions from the course assignments online.\nReceiving code-level assistance from someone or something not associated with the course.\nGetting someone else to write the assignment code for you.\nAsking questions about the assignments on any online services outside of the course office hours or slack.\n\nCheating on quizzes, assignments, or the final project can include:\n\nReferring to any external resources while completing the assignment (phones, notes, etc.).\nCopying part of an answer off of another student’s paper, even if it is very small.\nUsing solutions provided by students who previously took the course.\n\n\n\nUse of chatGPT and other AI tools\nLarge language models (LLMs) are capable of producing exact solutions to many of the coding problems assigned in this class. That means we all basically have a solutions manual available for free.\nWith this in mind, the use of AI is permitted as follows:\n\nAssignments 1-7: AI tools are not permitted unless explicitly instructed. Copying code from an AI tool and submitting it as your own for these assignments will be considered cheating. In this section of the course, we are building foundational skills in computational thinking and problem solving. If you don’t master these skills, you won’t be able to interpret what chatGPT is giving you, and you won’t be able to test if it is wrong. Master these skills first - it is worth the effort.\nAssignments 8-13: AI tools are permitted, with caveats. If you do use an AI tool on these assignments, you must include a link to the chat conversation you had to receive full credit.\n\nLearn to use tools like ChatGPT as a learning assistant - a tool to help you accomplish the task - rather than just a solutions manual. One version of using it makes you a better and more efficient coder, the other robs you of that.\nIn the follow-on course to this one (EMSE 4572: Exploratory Data Analysis), the use of AI will be allowed to support your projects.\n\n\nPenalties\nViolations will be reported to the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities. Penalties are decided by the course instructors, and can vary based on the severity of the offense. Possible penalties include:\n\nReceiving a 0 on the assignment/quiz in question.\nReceiving a full letter grade deduction in the course.\nAutomatically failing the course.\n\nDepending on the student’s prior academic history, violations may also be accompanied by a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs, again at the instructors’ discretion. This can lead to university-level penalties, such as being suspended or expelled.\n\n\nPlagiarism Detection\nPrograms are naturally structured, which makes them very easy to compare for plagiarism. Automated plagiarism detection systems make this process even easier. Watch this video showing plagiarism detection software in action (this example is using Python code, but this also works for R code).\nIn short, if you copy code, we will know - don’t copy code!\n\n\nGrace Period\nCollege is a time when you do a lot of learning. Sometimes, you might make bad decisions or mistakes. The most important thing for you to do is to learn from your mistakes, to constantly grow, and become a better person.\nSometimes, students panic and copy code right before the deadline, then regret what they did afterwards. Therefore, you may rescind any homework submission for up to 24 hours after the deadline with no questions asked. Simply email the course instructors asking to delete the submission in question, and we will do so. Deleted submissions will not be considered during plagiarism detection, though of course they will also not be graded. However, it will always be better to get a 0 (or partial credit) on an assignment than to get a cheating violation!",

    "text": "EMSE 4571 / 6571Intro to Programming for AnalyticsSpring 2025\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides a foundation in programming for analytics using the R programming language with a comparison to Python. Topics covered include fundamentals of programming (operators, data types, objects, functions, conditionals, loops, strings, testing, and debugging) as well as techniques for working with data sets in R and Python (file input/output, data structures, data wrangling, data visualization, external packages, and reproducible reporting). Emphasis will be on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Students will primarily work on individual programming assignments to develop skills in computational problem solving, writing code, and working with data. Students will be assessed through quizzes, homework assignments, and exams. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of time spent live coding and working on practice problems in class. This course assumes no prior programming experience and is an ideal preparation for higher level courses in data analytics.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nDevelop simple programs to effectively solve medium-sized tasks by:\n\nEmploying modular, top-down design in program construction.\nPro-actively creating and writing test cases to test and debug code.\nApplying computational problem-solving skills to new problems.\n\nWrite clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code for working with data using:\n\nSequential, conditional, and loop statements.\nNumeric, string, and logical data types.\nData structures, including lists, vectors, and data frames.\n\nReproducibly import, export, manipulate, and visualize data.\n\nPrerequisites:\nThere are no prerequisites. Students are assumed to have zero prior programming experience for this course.",

In this case, copy all of the text in your .R file, then re-open RStudio by double clicking on the .RProj file, then open the .R file from inside RStudio and paste your code into the .R file.\nIf you’re on a windows computer, you may have opened RStudio from inside the zip file. As a result, you can’t save any files because everything is still zipped up. You have to go back and extract the files from the zip file before you can save anything. In this case, copy all of the text in your .R file, then quit RStudio, go unzip the folder, re-open RStudio by double clicking on the .RProj file, then open the .R file from inside RStudio and paste your code into the .R file.",

I’ll send all course communication via Slack, so please make sure your notifications are on so you don’t miss anything.\nInstall the latest version of R and RStudio:\n\n\nDownload and install R (version 4.0.2 or higher)\nDownload and install RStudio (Desktop version)\n\n\nIf you have a Mac, install XQuartz. This is needed for making some figures and is only for Mac (if you’re on Windows or Linux, skip this step).\nSign up for Posit Cloud (the free version). It’s basically the same thing as RStudio, but accessible via a web browser. If things aren’t working on your computer, this is a great backup to quickly get back to working in RStudio.\n\n\nFor reference, “Posit” is the company that makes “RStudio”, the software we’ll use to work with R.\n\nThat’s it - you’re all set for class!",
