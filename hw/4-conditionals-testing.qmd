### 1) Staying organized [SOLO, 5%]

Download and use [this template](templates/hw4.zip) for your assignment. Inside the "hw4" folder, open and edit the R script called "hw4.R" and fill out your name, Net ID, and the names of anyone you worked with on this assignment.

> ### **Writing test functions**
>
> For each of the following functions, write a test function first, and then write the function. **Your test functions will count for half of the available credit for each problem**. Think carefully about the test cases to include in your test functions.

> ### Using the [autograder](../autograder.html)
>
> - You can check your solutions to problems 2 - 6 by logging into the [autograder](../autograder.html) and uploading your `hw4.R` file.
> - **The file must be named `hw4.R` or it won't work.**
> - Your user name is your netID, and your password is inside the `readme.txt` file in the Box folder I shared with you.

### 2) `isPositiveMultipleOf4Or7(n)` [SOLO, 10%]

Write the function `isPositiveMultipleOf4Or7(n)` that returns `TRUE` if `n` is a positive multiple of 4 or 7 and `FALSE` otherwise. Note than `n` could be any data type.

### 3) `isEvenPositiveInt(x)` [SOLO, 15%]

Given an arbitrary value `x`, return `TRUE` if it is an integer, and it is positive, and it is even (all 3 must be true), or `FALSE` otherwise. If the value `x` is not an integer, the function should return `FALSE` rather than error. So, `isEvenPositiveInt("yikes!")` returns `FALSE`, and `isEvenPositiveInt(123456)` returns `TRUE`.

### 4) `isLeapYear(year)` [COLLABORATIVE, 20%]

Write the function `isLeapYear(year)` that returns `TRUE` if `year` is a [leap year](https://www.mathsisfun.com/leap-years.html) and `FALSE` otherwise. Assume that `year` is a positive integer.

### 5) `getTheCents(n)` [COLLABORATIVE, 20%]

Write the function `getTheCents(n)` which takes a value `n` that represents a payment in US dollars and returns the number of cents in the payment. For example, if `n` is `2.45`, the function should return `45`. If `n` is an integer, the function should return `0`, as it has `0` cents; if it isn't a number, it should return `NULL`, because a non-number payment make no cents (ha!). If the payment has partial cents (for example, `3.953`), it should be rounded to the nearest cent (in this case, `95` cents).

### 6) `isNumericLooking(n)` [COLLABORATIVE, 20%]

Write a function that returns `TRUE` if the value `n` is "numeric looking", meaning that it is either of a numeric type or a character type of a number (e.g. "2"). All other data types and special values (e.g. `NA`, `NaN`, `Inf`, `NULL`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`, etc.) should return `FALSE`.

### 7) Read and reflect [SOLO, 10%]
